# Discuss implications based on results
# For example:
# - Harvest yield increases with r-values but may compromise population stability.
# - A balance between harvest rate and population growth is crucial for sustainable harvesting.
# - Policies regulating harvest rates should consider both economic benefits and ecological sustainability.
